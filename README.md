# Bus Demand Prediction Backend Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a machine learning backend for the Bus Demand Prediction application. The backend includes a trained model, API endpoints, and a database with Texas locations.

## Components

### Machine Learning Model

- **Model Type**: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Training Samples**: 800
- **Test Samples**: 200

The model was trained on the provided dataset and saved using joblib. It predicts bus demand based on start location, end location, occasion, season, and time.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/locations**: Get all available locations
- **GET /api/locations/{location_id}**: Get a specific location
- **POST /api/predict**: Make a prediction for bus demand
- **GET /api/predictions/history**: Get prediction history
- **GET /api/model/metrics**: Get model metrics

### Database

- **Locations**: 40 Texas cities with IDs, names, and descriptions
- **Prediction Logs**: Table to store prediction history
- **Prediction Details**: Table to store detailed prediction results

## Implementation Details

### Model Training

1. Loaded and preprocessed the dataset
2. Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
3. Evaluated multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, ElasticNet)
4. Selected Gradient Boosting as the best performing model
5. Fine-tuned the model with hyperparameter optimization
6. Saved the model using joblib

### API Implementation

1. Created a FastAPI application with proper CORS configuration
2. Implemented endpoints for locations and predictions
3. Connected the API to the trained model
4. Added error handling and validation
5. Implemented logging for debugging

### Database Setup

1. Created a SQLite database with the necessary tables
2. Added 40 Texas locations to the database
3. Implemented functions to log predictions and retrieve history

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. Access the API documentation:
   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Model Accuracy**: Collect more data and experiment with advanced models
2. **Add Authentication**: Implement user authentication for API access
3. **Deploy to Production**: Set up a production environment with proper scaling
4. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for model performance and API usage
